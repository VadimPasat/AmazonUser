## Overview
The automation tests simulate an Amazon purchase flow for a new user, including steps to search for the most affordable Snickers and Skittles, add them to the cart, and confirm that the total price is calculated correctly. During the checkout process, the test ensures that users without an account are prompted to register.
Key dependencies and technologies used:
1. Design patterns: Single Tone, Factory Method, Abstract Factory,etc.
2. Core Language & Framework:
   Java: was chosen due to its versatility and compatibility with Selenium.
   Cucumber: Enables Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) by using Gherkin syntax to create human-readable test cases. It also allows tests to be documented in a descriptive language thatâ€™s exportable for automated reporting.
3. Web Automation Tool:
   Selenium WebDriver: The main driver for browser automation in this project. Selenium WebDriver supports multiple browsers and can easily be configured for Chrome.
   WebDriverManager: For dynamic browser driver management, ensuring that the latest drivers for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc., are available without manual setup.
4. Browser and Platform Compatibility:
      Cross-Browser Support: Selenium WebDriver will manage this, allowing tests to run on different browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
      Cross-Platform Support: You would configure the framework to work on Windows, macOS, and Linux by including necessary WebDriver binaries and potentially using WebDriverManager to fetch the correct driver versions.
5. Test Execution:
   JUnit/TestNG: To organize and run test suites.
